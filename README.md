# Robot kinematics 3d manipulator:

	The equations for Θ1_dot, Θ2_dot and Θ3_dot are derived and showed in the shared pdf file. 

	According to those equations, Jacobian inverse is supposed to be finded out for the final calculations.

	The Jacobian inverse is calculated using Python SymPy library. Also, required symbols are defined for the same.

### How to run the code:
		The code requires following libraries to be installed before running: sympy

	This code does not need any input.

###	Output:
		In the terminal window,
		1. The Jacobian inverse matrix is shown.
		2. The values for Θ1_dot, Θ2_dot and Θ3_dot are shown.
